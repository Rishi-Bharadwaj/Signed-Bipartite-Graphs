Here im trying to implement community detection in signed bipartite graphs using modularity. 
I have been testing different message passing architectures.
I also adapted modularity to work for signed bipartite networks. 
Some of the math can be seen in the write-up ive written in this repository.
I have labelled my notebooks in the order i wrote them, its still a work in progress so new files will be uploaded.
